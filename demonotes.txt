In this demo, we will illustrate how to use git branching, i.e., work with different 
branches, push, pull and merge. 

Firstly, the main is the branch that we only use to document things.

Secondly, we will create a branch named pets in which we add a txt file listing
animals that are pets.

Then, another branch named non-pets for a txt file listing animals that are non-pets.

So now we have all the files and all the branches apart from the main are deleted.
We will now start to have two branches working on the same file so as to see merge conflicts.
